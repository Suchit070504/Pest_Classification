**ðŸª² Pest Detection & Pesticide Recommendation System**

A PyTorch-based deep learning system for automated pest classification and pesticide recommendation using EfficientNet-B0.

**Features**
Multi-class Classification: Identifies 102 pest categories with 67.75% accuracy
Smart Recommendations: Provides pesticide suggestions and dosages via CSV mapping
Robust Training: Includes data augmentation, dropout regularization, and early stopping
Performance Analytics: Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall analysis

**Model Architecture**
Base: EfficientNet-B0 (ImageNet pretrained)
Custom Head: Dropout (0.5) + FC layer for 102 classes
Optimizer: Adam (lr=5e-4, weight_decay=1e-4)
Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau with early stopping
